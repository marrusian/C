- There are TWO TYPES of TIME that are of interest to a process:
  a) REAL TIME, which is measured either from some STANDARD POINT (CALENDAR time) or from some FIXED POINT,
    typically the start, in the life of a process (ELAPSED or WALL CLOCK time). On UNIX systems, calendar time
    is measured in seconds since midnight on the morning of Januaray 1, 1970, UTC, and coordinated on the base
    point for timezones defined by the longitudinal line passing through Greenwich, England. This date, which
    is close to the BIRTH of the UNIX system, is referred to as the Epoch.
  b) PROCESS TIME (also called CPU TIME), which is the total amount of CPU time that a process has used since
    starting. CPU time is further divided into:
       b1) SYSTEM CPU TIME - the time spent EXECUTING CODE in KERNEL MODE (i.e., executing SYSTEM CALLS and
                             performing other KERNEL SERVICES on BEHALF of the process).
       b2) USER CPU TIME - the time spent EXECUTING CODE in USER MODE (i.e., executing NORMAL PROGRAM CODE).

- The "time" command displays the real time, the system CPU time, and user CPU time taken to execute the
processes in a pipeline.
