- A "CLIENT-SERVER APPLICATION" is one that is broken into two component processes:
   1) a CLIENT, which ASKS the server to CARRY OUT some SERVICE by sending it a REQUEST MESSAGE;
   2) a SERVER, which EXAMINES the client's REQUEST, PERFORMS appropriate actions, and then sends a RESPONSE
     MESSAGE back to the client.

- Sometimes, the client and server may engage in an extended dialogue of requests and responses.

- Typically, the client application interacts with a USER, while the server application PROVIDES ACCESS to some
SHARED RESOURCE. Commonly, there are MULTIPLE INSTANCES of CLIENT PROCESSES communicating with one or a few
instances of the server process.

- The client and server may reside on the SAME HOST COMPUTER or on SEPARATE HOSTS connected via a NETWORK. To
communicate with one another, the client and server use the IPC mechanisms.
- Servers may implement a VARIETY OF SERVICES, such as:
   a) providing access to a database or other shared information resource;
   b) providing access to a remote file across a network;
   c) encapsulating some business logic;
   d) providing access to a shared hardware resource (e.g., a printer);
   e) serving web pages.

- Encapsulating a service within a single server is useful for a number of reasons, such as the following:
   - EFFICIENCY: it may be CHEAPER to provide one instance of a resource (e.g., a printer) that is managed by
                 a server than to provide the same resource locally on every computer.
   - CONTROL, COORDINATION, and SECURITY: by holding a resource (especially an information resource) at a
                                          SINGLE LOCATION, the server can coordinate access to the resource
                                          (e.g., so that two clients don't simultaneously update the same piece
                                          of information) or secure it so that it is made available to only
                                          selected clients.
   - Operation in a HETEROGENOUS ENVIRONMENT: in a NETWORK, the various clients, and the server, can be running
                                              on different hardware and operating system platforms.
