- A 'LOCALE' refers to C's facility for specifying a locale that MODIFIES or EXTENDS basic C usage. For
example, many nations use a comma instead of a decimal point when writing decimal fractions).

- Because in the wider world NOT all keyboards have the same symbols as the U.S. keyboards do, the C99
standard added alternative spellings for the logical operators, which are defined in the "iso646.h" header
file. These alternative spellings are:
   '&&' <=> "and"
   '||' <=> "or"
   '!'  <=> "not"

- C PROBABLY didn't simply use the new terms because, historically, C has tried to keep the number of
keywords small.

- Aside from the cases in which two operators SHARE an operand, C ordinarily does NOT guarantee which
parts of a complex expression are evaluated first. This ambiguity was left in the language so that 
compiler designers could make the MOST EFFICIENT CHOICE for a particular system.

- C GUARANTEES that logical expressions are evaluated from left to right. This means '&&' and '||' 
operators are SEQUENCE POINTS, so all side effects take place BEFORE a program moves from one operand
to the next. Furthermore, it GUARANTEES that as soon as an element is found that INVALIDATES the
expression as a whole, the evaluation STOPS. 

- C offers a SHORTHAND way to express one form of the "if else" statement. It is called a CONDITIONAL
EXPRESSION and uses the '?:' conditional operator, which is a TERNARY operator and C's ONLY example
in that category.
