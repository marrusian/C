- The SAVED set-UID and SAVED set-GID are DESIGNED for use with set-UID and set-GID programs. When a program
is EXECUTED, the following steps (among MANY OTHERS) occur:
     1) If the set-UID/set-GID permission bit is ENABLED on the EXECUTABLE, then the EFFECTIVE UID/GID of the
        process is MADE THE SAME as the OWNER of the EXECUTABLE. If the set-UID/set-GID bit is NOT SET, then
        NO CHANGE is made to the EFFECTIVE UID/GID of the process.

     2) The VALUES for the SAVED set-UID and SAVED set-GID are COPIED from the CORRESPONDING EFFECTIVE IDs.
        This copying occurs REGARDLESS of WHETHER the set-UID and set-GID bit is set on the file being
        executed.

- As an EXAMPLE of the EFFECT of the ABOVE STEPS, suppose that a process whose REAL UID, EFFECTIVE UID, and
SAVED set-UID are ALL SET to 1000, execs a set-UID program OWNED by "root" (UID 0). After the exec, the UIDs
of the process will be changed as follows:
        real=1000   effective=0   saved=0

- Various system calls ALLOW a set-UID program to SWITCH its EFFECTIVE UID between the values of the REAL UID
and the SAVED set-UID. Analogous system calls ALLOW a set-GID program to MODIFY its EFFECTIVE GID. In this
manner, the program can TEMPORARILY DROP and REGAIN whatever privileges are associated with the UID/GID of the
execed file (in other words, the program can move between the states of potentially being privileged and
actually operating with privilege). As we'll elaborate in Section 38.2, it is SECURE PROGRAMMING PRACTICE for
set-UID and set-GID programs to OPERATE UNDER the UNPRIVILEGED (i.e. REAL) ID WHENEVER the program DOESN'T
ACTUALLY NEED to perform any operations associated with the PRIVILEGED (i.e., SAVED SET) ID.

                 Note:  The SAVED set-UID and SAVED set-GID are SOMETIMES SYNONYMOUSLY REFERRED to as the
                      "SAVED UID" and "SAVED GID".   
                        The SAVED set-IDs are a System V invention ADOPTED by POSIX. They were NOT PROVIDED on
                      releases of BSD prior to 4.4. The INITIAL POSIX.1 standard made SUPPORT for these IDs
                      OPTIONAL, but LATER STANDARDS (starting with FIPS 151-1 in 1988) made support MANDATORY.
