- Each user has a UNIQUE LOGIN NAME and an ASSOCIATED numeric user ID (UID). Users can BELONG to ONE OR MORE
GROUPS, each of which also has a UNIQUE NAME and an ASSOCIATED numeric group ID (GID). The PRIMARY PURPOSE of
these IDENTIFIERS is to ESTABLISH OWNERSHIP of VARIOUS SYSTEM RESOURCES (e.g., files) and PERMISSIONS for
ACCESSING them.

- A user's name and ID are DEFINED in the "/etc/passwd" file, which also contains OTHER INFORMATION about the
user. A user's GROUP MEMBERSHIPS are DEFINED by fields in the "/etc/passwd" and "/etc/group" files. A further
file, "/etc/shadow", which can be ONLY READ by PRIVILEGED PROCESSES, is USED to SEPARATE the SENSITIVE
PASSWORD INFORMATION from the PUBLICLY AVAILABLE USER INFORMATION in "/etc/passwd". Various LIBRARY FUNCTIONS
are PROVIDED for RETRIEVING INFORMATION from each of these files.

- The "crypt()" function ENCRYPTS a PASSWORD in the SAME MANNER as the STANDARD "LOGIN" PROGRAM, which is
USEFUL for programs that NEED to AUTHENTICATE USERS.
