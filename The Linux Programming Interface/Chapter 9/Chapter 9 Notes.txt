- Every process has a SET of ASSOCIATED numeric user identifiers (UIDs) and group identifiers (GIDs).
Sometimes, these are referred to as PROCESS CREDENTIALS. These identifiers are as follows:
    a) Real UID and GID;
    b) Effective UID and GID;
    c) Saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID;
    d) File-system UID and GID (Linux-specific !);
    e) Supplementary GIDs.

############################################################################################################
- The RUID and RGID IDENTIFY the USER AND GROUP to which the PROCESS BELONGS. As part of the LOGIN PROCESS,
a LOGIN SHELL gets its real UIDs and GIDs from the THIRD and FOURTH FIELDS of the USER'S PASSWORD RECORD in
the "/etc/passwd" file. When a NEW PROCESS is CREATED (e.g., when the shell executes a program), it INHERITS
these IDENTIFIERS from its PARENT.

############################################################################################################
- On MOST UNIX implementations (Linux is a LITTLE DIFFERENT, as explained in Section 9.5), the EFFECTIVE user
ID and group ID, in CONJUNCTION with the SUPPLEMENTARY group IDs, are used to DETERMINE the PERMISSIONS
GRANTED to a PROCESS when it tries to PERFORM VARIOUS OPERATIONS (i.e., SYSTEM CALLS). For example, these
identifiers DETERMINE the PERMISSIONS GRANTED to a PROCESS when it ACCESSES RESOURCES such as FILES and
System V IPC objects, which THEMSELVES have ASSOCIATED UIDs and GIDs determining TO WHOM they BELONG.
The EFFECTIVE UID is ALSO USED by the KERNEL to DETERMINE WHETHER one process can SEND a SIGNAL to another.

- A PROCESS whose EFFECTIVE UID is 0 (the UID of "root") has ALL of the PRIVILEGES of the SUPERUSER. Such a
process is referred to as a "PRIVILEGED PROCESS". Certain system calls can be executed ONLY by PRIVILEGED
PROCESSES.

                  Note: In Chapter 39, we describe Linux's implementation of CAPABILITIES, a SCHEME that
                       DIVIDES the PRIVILEGES GRANTED to a SUPERUSER into a number of DISTINCT UNITS that can
                       be INDEPENDENTLY enabled and disabled.

- Normally, the EFFECTIVE UIDs and GIDs have the SAME VALUES as the CORRESPONDING REAL IDs, but there are
TWO WAYS in which the EFFECTIVE IDs can ASSUME DIFFERENT values:
      1) Through the use of SYSTEM CALLS that we discuss in Section 9.7;
      2) Through the EXECUTION of set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.

############################################################################################################
- A set-user-ID program ALLOWS a PROCESS to GAIN PRIVILEGES it would NOT NORMALLY have, by SETTING the
process's EFFECTIVE UID to the SAME VALUE as the UID (OWNER) of the EXECUTABLE FILE. A set-group-ID program
performs the ANALOGOUS TASK for the process's EFFECTIVE GID (the TERMS "set-user-ID program" and
"set-group-ID program" are SOMETIMES ABBREVIATED as "set-UID program" and "set-GID program").

- Like any other file, an EXECUTABLE PROGRAM FILE has an ASSOCIATED UID and GID that DEFINE the OWNERSHIP of
the file. In addition, an EXECUTABLE FILE has TWO SPECIAL PERMISSION BITS:
       1) The set-UID bit;
       2) The set-GID bit;
(In fact, EVERY FILE has these TWO PERMISSION BITS, but it is their use with EXECUTABLE FILES that interests
us here).

- These PERMISSION BITS are SET using the "chmod" command. An UNPRIVILEGED USER can SET these BITS for FILES
that they OWN. A PRIVILEGED USER (CAP_FOWNER) can SET these BITS for ANY FILE. 

- It is POSSIBLE for a PROGRAM to have BOTH of these bits SET, although this is UNCOMMON. When "ls -l" is used
to LIST the PERMISSIONS for a program that has the set-UID and set-GID permission bit SET, then the 'x' that
is NORMALLY USED to INDICATE that EXECUTE PERMISSION is SET is REPLACED by an 's':
        # ls -l prog
        # -rwsr-sr-x     1   root       root       302585    Jun 26 15:05 prog

- When a set-UID program is RUN (i.e., LOADED into a PROCESS'S MEMORY by an "exec()"), the KERNEL SETS the
EFFECTIVE UID of the process to be the SAME as the UID of the EXECUTABLE FILE. Running a set-GID program has
an ANALOGOUS EFFECT for the EFFECTIVE GID of the process. Changing the EFFECTIVE UID or GID in this way gives
a process (in other words, the USER EXECUTING the PROGRAM) PRIVILEGES it would NOT NORMALLY have. For example,
IF an EXECUTABLE FILE is OWNED by "root" (superuser) and has the set-UID permission bit ENABLED, then the
process gains SUPERUSER PRIVILEGES when that program is run.

- Set-UID and set-GID programs can ALSO be DESIGNED to CHANGE the EFFECTIVE IDs of a process to SOMETHING
OTHER than "root". For example, to PROVIDE ACCES to a PROTECTED FILE (or OTHER SYSTEM RESOURCE), it MAY
SUFFICE to CREATE a SPECIAL PURPOSE UID/GID that has the privileges REQUIRED to ACCESS the FILE, and CREATE a
set-UID/set-GID program that CHANGES the EFFECTIVE UID/GID of a process to THAT ID. This PERMITS the program
to ACCESS the file WITHOUT ALLOWING it ALL of the PRIVILEGES of the SUPERUSER.

- Sometimes, we'll use the term set-UID-root to DISTINGUISH a set-UID program that is OWNED by "root" FROM one
OWNED by ANOTHER USER, which MERELY GIVES a process the PRIVILEGES accorded to THAT USER.

                 Note:  We have now started using the term "privileged" in TWO DIFFERENT SENSES. One is the
                      sense DEFINED EARLIER: a process with an EFFECTIVE UID of 0, which has ALL of the
                      PRIVILEGES accorded to "root". However, when we are talking about a set-UID program
                      owned by a user OTHER THAN "root", we'll sometimes refer to a process as GAINING the
                      PRIVILEGES accorded to the UID of the set-UID program. Which sense of the term
                      "privileged" we mean in EACH CASE should be CLEAR from the CONTEXT.
                        For reasons that we explain in Section 38.3, the set-UID and set-GID permission bits
                      DON'T have ANY EFFECT for SHELL SCRIPTS on Linux.

- Examples of COMMONLY USED set-UID programs on Linux include:
     a) "passwd(1)"               - changes a user's password;
     b) "mount(8) and "umount(8)" - mount and unmount file systems;
     c) "su(1)"                   - allows a user to run a shell under a different user ID.

- An EXAMPLE of a set-GID program is "wall(1)", which writes a message to ALL TERMINALS OWNED by the "tty"
group (normally, EVERY TERMINAL is OWNED by THIS GROUP).

- The set-UID/set-GID technique is a USEFUL and POWERFUL TOOL, but one that can result in SECURITY BREACHES
in APPLICATIONS that are POORLY DESIGNED. In Chapter 38, we LIST a SET of GOOD PRACTICES that should be
observed when writing set-UID and set-GID programs.

############################################################################################################
- The SAVED set-UID and SAVED set-GID are DESIGNED for use with set-UID and set-GID programs. When a program
is EXECUTED, the following steps (among MANY OTHERS) occur:
     1) If the set-UID/set-GID permission bit is ENABLED on the EXECUTABLE, then the EFFECTIVE UID/GID of the
        process is MADE THE SAME as the OWNER of the EXECUTABLE. If the set-UID/set-GID bit is NOT SET, then
        NO CHANGE is made to the EFFECTIVE UID/GID of the process.

     2) The VALUES for the SAVED set-UID and SAVED set-GID are COPIED from the CORRESPONDING EFFECTIVE IDs.
        This copying occurs REGARDLESS of WHETHER the set-UID and set-GID bit is set on the file being
        executed.

- As an EXAMPLE of the EFFECT of the ABOVE STEPS, suppose that a process whose REAL UID, EFFECTIVE UID, and
SAVED set-UID are ALL SET to 1000, execs a set-UID program OWNED by "root" (UID 0). After the exec, the UIDs
of the process will be changed as follows:
        real=1000   effective=0   saved=0

- Various system calls ALLOW a set-UID program to SWITCH its EFFECTIVE UID between the values of the REAL UID
and the SAVED set-UID. Analogous system calls ALLOW a set-GID program to MODIFY its EFFECTIVE GID. In this
manner, the program can TEMPORARILY DROP and REGAIN whatever privileges are associated with the UID/GID of the
execed file (in other words, the program can move between the states of potentially being privileged and
actually operating with privilege). As we'll elaborate in Section 38.2, it is SECURE PROGRAMMING PRACTICE for
set-UID and set-GID programs to OPERATE UNDER the UNPRIVILEGED (i.e. REAL) ID WHENEVER the program DOESN'T
ACTUALLY NEED to perform any operations associated with the PRIVILEGED (i.e., SAVED SET) ID.

                 Note:  The SAVED set-UID and SAVED set-GID are SOMETIMES SYNONYMOUSLY REFERRED to as the
                      "SAVED UID" and "SAVED GID".   
                        The SAVED set-IDs are a System V invention ADOPTED by POSIX. They were NOT PROVIDED on
                      releases of BSD prior to 4.4. The INITIAL POSIX.1 standard made SUPPORT for these IDs
                      OPTIONAL, but LATER STANDARDS (starting with FIPS 151-1 in 1988) made support MANDATORY.

############################################################################################################
- On Linux, it is the FILE-SYSTEM user and group IDs, RATHER than the EFFECTIVE user and group IDs, that are
USED (in CONJUNCTION with the SUPPLEMENTARY GIDs) to DETERMINE PERMISSIONS when performing FILE-SYSTEM
OPERATIONS such as: opening files, changing file ownership, and modifying file permissions (the EFFECTIVE IDs
are STILL USED, as on OTHER UNIX implementations, for the OTHER PURPOSES described earlier).

- Normally, the FILE-SYSTEM IDs have the SAME VALUES as the CORRESPONDING EFFECTIVE IDs (and thus TYPICALLY
are THE SAME as the CORRESPONDING REAL IDs). Furthermore, WHENEVER the EFFECTIVE UID/GID is CHANGED, either
by a system call or by execution of a set-UID or set-GID program, the CORRESPONDING FILE-SYSTEM ID is ALSO
CHANGED to the SAME VALUE. Since the FILE-SYSTEM IDs follow the EFFECTIVE IDs in this way, this means that
Linux EFFECTIVELY BEHAVES just like ANY OTHER UNIX implementation when PRIVILEGES and PERMISSIONS are being
CHECKED. The FILE-SYSTEM IDs DIFFER from the CORRESPONDING EFFECTIVE IDs, and hence Linux DIFFERS from OTHER
UNIX implementations, ONLY WHEN we use TWO Linux-specific system calls, "setfsuid()" and "setfsgid()", to
EXPLICITLY make them DIFFERENT.

- Why does Linux provide the FILE-SYSTEM IDs and in what circumstances would we want the EFFECTIVE and
FILE-SYSTEM IDs to differ? The reasons are PRIMARILY HISTORICAL. The file-system IDs FIRST APPEARED in
Linux 1.2. In that kernel version, one process COULD SEND a SIGNAL to another ONLY if the EFFECTIVE UID of the
sender MATCHED the REAL or EFFECTIVE UID of the TARGET PROCESS. This AFFECTED certain programs such as the
Linux NFS (Network File System) server program, which NEEDED to be ABLE to ACCESS files AS THOUGH it had the
EFFECTIVE IDs of the corresponding CLIENT PROCESS. However, if the NFS server CHANGED its EUID, it would be
VULNERABLE to SINGALS from UNPRIVILEGED user processes. To PREVENT this possibility, the SEPARATE file-system
user and group IDs were DEVISED. By LEAVING its EUIDs UNCHANGED, but CHANGING its FILE-SYSTEM IDs, the NFS
server could MASQUERADE as ANOTHER USER for the PURPOSE of ACCESSING files WITHOUT being VULNERABLE to SIGNALS
from user processes.

- From kernel 2.0 ONWARD, Linux ADOPTED the SUSv3-mandated RULES regarding PERMISSION for SENDING SIGNALS, and
these rules DON'T INVOLVE the EUID of the TARGET PROCESS. Thus, the FILE-SYSTEM ID feature is NO LONGER
strictly NECESSARY (a process can nowadays achieve the desired results by making JUDICIOUS use of the system
calls described later to CHANGE the VALUE of the EUID TO and FROM an UNPRIVILEGED VALUE, as REQUIRED), but it
REMAINS for COMPATIBILITY with EXISTING SOFTWARE.

############################################################################################################
- The SUPPLEMENTARY GIDs are a SET of ADDITIONAL GROUPS to which a process BELONGS. A new process INHERITS
these IDs from its PARENT. A LOGIN SHELL obtains its SUPPLEMENTARY GIDs from the SYSTEM GROUP FILE. As noted
above, these IDs are used in CONJUNCTION with the EFFECTIVE and FILE-SYSTEM IDs to DETERMINE PERMISSIONS for
ACCESSING FILES, System V IPC objects, and OTHER SYSTEM RESOURCES.

############################################################################################################
- Linux provides a RANGE of SYSTEM CALLS and LIBRARY FUNCTIONS for RETRIEVING and CHANGING the various
UIDs/GIDs that we have described. Only SOME of these APIs are SPECIFIED in SUSv3. Of the remainder, SEVERAL
are WIDELY AVAILABLE on OTHER UNIX implementations and a FEW are Linux-specific. 

- As an ALTERNATIVE to using the system calls described next, the CREDENTIALS of ANY PROCESS can be FOUND by
EXAMINING the "Uid", "Gid", and "Groups" LINES provided in the Linux-specific "/proc/PID/status" file. The
"Uid" and "Gid" lines LIST the IDENTIFIERS in the order REAL, EFFECTIVE, SAVED SET, and FILE SYSTEM.

- In the following sections, we use the TRADITIONAL DEFINITION of a PRIVILEGED PROCESS as one whose EUID is 0.
However, Linux DIVIDES the notion of SUPERUSER PRIVILEGES into DISTINCT CAPABILITIES. Two capabilities are
RELEVANT for our discussion of ALL of the SYSTEM CALLS used to CHANGE process UIDs and GIDs:
    a) The 'CAP_SETUID' capability ALLOWS a PROCESS to make ARBITRARY CHANGES to its UIDs;
    b) The 'CAP_SETGID' capability ALLOWS a PROCESS to make ARBITRARY CHANGES to its GIDs;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The "getuid()" and "getgid()" system calls RETURN, respectively, the REAL UID and REAL GID of the CALLING
PROCESS. The "geteuid()" and "getegid()" system calls PERFORM the CORRESPONDING TASKS for the EFFECTIVE IDs.
These system calls are ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL:
           DEP: #include <unistd.h>          PROTO: uid_t getuid(void);
                                             RET: Returns REAL UID of calling process;
  
                                             PROTO: uid_t geteuid(void);
                                             RET: Returns EFFECTIVE UID of calling process;

                                             PROTO: gid_t getgid(void);
                                             RET: Returns REAL GID of calling process;

                                             PROTO: gid_t getegid(void);
                                             RET: Returns EFFECTIVE GID of calling process;

- The "setuid()" system call CHANGES the EUID - and POSSIBLY the REAL UID and the SAVED SET-UID - of the 
CALLING PROCESS to the VALUE given by the "uid" argument. The "setgid()" system call PERFORMS the ANALOGOUS
TASK for the CORRESPONDING GIDs:
           DEP: #include <unistd.h>          PROTO: int setuid(uid_t uid);
                                             PROTO: int setgid(gid_t gid);
                                             RET: Both return 0 on success, or -1 on error

- The RULES about WHAT CHANGES a process can MAKE to its CREDENTIALS using "setuid()" and "setgid()" DEPEND
on WHETHER the process is PRIVILEGED (i.e., has an EUID equal to 0). The following rules apply to "setuid()":
      1) When an UNPRIVILEGED PROCESS calls "setuid()", ONLY the EUID of the process is CHANGED. Furthermore,
         it can be ONLY CHANGED to the SAME VALUE as EITHER the RUID or SSUID (attempts to VIOLATE this
         CONSTRAINT yield the error "EPERM"). This means that, for UNPRIVILEGED USERS, this call is ONLY
         USEFUL when EXECUTING a SUID program, since, for the EXECUTION of NORMAL programs, the process's
         RUID, EUID, and SSUID all have the SAME VALUE. On some BSD-derived implementations, calls to
         "setuid()" or "setgid()" by an UNPRIVILEGED PROCESS have DIFFERENT SEMANTICS from OTHER UNIX
         implementations: the calls CHANGE the REAL, EFFECTIVE, and SAVED SET IDs (to the value of the current
         REAL or EFFECTIVE ID).

      2) When a PRIVILEGED PROCESS executes "setuid()" with a NONZERO argument, then the RUID, EUID, and SSUID
         are ALL SET to the VALUE specified in the "uid" argument. This is a ONE-WAY TRIP, in that ONCE a
         PRIVILEGED PROCESS has CHANGED its IDENTIFIERS in this way, it LOSES ALL PRIVILEGES and therefore
         CAN'T subsequently use "setuid()" to RESET the IDENTIFIERS BACK to 0. If this is NOT DESIRED, then
         EITHER "seteuid()" or "setreuid()" should be USED INSTEAD of "setuid()".

- The RULES GOVERNING the CHANGES that may be made to GIDs using "setgid()" are SIMILAR, but with "setgid()"
SUBSTITUTED for "setuid()" and "GROUP" for "USER". With these changes, RULE 1 applies EXACTLY as STATED.
In RULE 2, since CHANGING the GIDs DOESN'T CAUSE a process to LOSE PRIVILEGES (which are DETERMINED by the
EUID), PRIVILEGED PROGRAMS can use "setgid()" to FREELY CHANGE the GIDs to ANY DESIRED VALUES.

- The following call is the PREFERRED METHOD for a SUID-root program whose EUID is CURRENTLY 0 to IRREVOCABLY
DROP ALL PRIVILEGES (by setting BOTH the EUID and SSUID to the SAME VALUE as the RUID):
           # if(setuid(getuid()) == -1)
           #    errExit("setuid()");

- A SUID program OWNED by a user OTHER THAN "root" can use "setuid()" to SWITCH the EUID BETWEEN the values of
the RUID and SSUID for the SECURITY REASONS described in Section 9.4. However, "seteuid()" is PREFERABLE for
this purpose, since it has the SAME EFFECT, REGARDLESS of WHETHER the SUID program is OWNED by "root".

- A process can use "seteuid()" to CHANGE its EUID (to the VALUE specified by "euid"), and "setegid()" to
CHANGE its EGID (to the VALUE specified by "egid"):
           DEP: #include <unistd.h>          PROTO: int seteuid(uid_t euid);
                                             PROTO: int setegid(gid_t egid);
                                             RET: Both return 0 on success, or -1 on error

- The following RULES GOVERN the CHANGES that a process MAY MAKE to its EFFECTIVE IDs using "seteuid()" and
"setegid()":
      1) An UNPRIVILEGED PROCESS can CHANGE an EID ONLY to the SAME VALUE as the CORRESPONDING RID or SSID
         (in other words, for an UNPRIVILEGED PROCESS, "seteuid()" and "setegid()" have the SAME EFFECT as
         "setuid()" and "setgid()", respectively, EXCEPT for the BSD PORTABILITY ISSUES noted earlier).

      2) A PRIVILEGED PROCESS can CHANGE an EID to ANY VALUE. If a PRIVILEGED PROCESS uses "seteuid()" to
         CHANGE its EUID to a NONZERO value, then it CEASES to be PRIVILEGED (but MAY BE ABLE to REGAIN
         PRIVILEGE via the PREVIOUS RULE).

- Using "seteuid()" is the PREFERRED METHOD for SUID and SGID programs to TEMPORARILY DROP and LATER REGAIN
PRIVILEGES. Here's an example:
           # euid = geteuid();            /* Save initial EUID (which is the SAME as SSUID) */
           #
           # if(seteuid(getuid()) == -1)  /* Drop privileges */
           #    errExit("seteuid()");
           # if(seteuid(euid) == -1)      /* Regain privileges */
           #    errExit("seteuid()");

- Originally DERIVED from BSD, "seteuid()" and "setegid()" are now SPECIFIED in SUSv3 and APPEAR on MOST UNIX
implementations.

               Note:   In OLDER VERSIONS of the GNU C Library ("glibc 2.0" and EARLIER), "seteuid(euid)" is
                     IMPLEMENTED as "setreuid(-1, euid)". In MODERN VERSIONS of "glibc", "seteuid(euid)" is
                     IMPLEMENTED as "setresuid(-1, euid, -1)". Both implementations PERMIT US to SPECIFY
                     "euid" as the SAME VALUE as the CURRENT EUID (i.e., NO CHANGE). However, SUSv3 DOESN'T
                     SPECIFY this BEHAVIOUR for "seteuid()", and it is NOT POSSIBLE on SOME OTHER UNIX
                     implementations. Generally, this POTENTIAL VARIATION across implementations is NOT
                     APPARENT, since, in NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, the EUID has the SAME VALUE as EITHER the RUID
                     or the SSUID (the ONLY WAY in which we can MAKE the EUID DIFFER from BOTH the RUID and
                     SSUID on Linux is VIA the use of the NONSTANDARD "setresuid()" system call).
                       ANALOGOUS REMARKS apply for the "glibc" implementation of "setegid(egid)", EXCEPT that
                     the SWITCH in implementation FROM "setregid(-1, egid)" TO "setresgid(-1, egid, -1)"
                     OCCURED in "glibc" 2.2 OR 2.3 (the PRECISE version DEPENDS on the HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE).

- The "setreuid()" system call ALLOWS the CALLING PROCESS to INDEPENDENTLY CHANGE the VALUES of its RUID and
EUID. The "setregid()" system call PERFORMS the ANALOGOUS TASK for the RGID and EGID:
           DEP: #include <unistd.h>          PROTO: int setreuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid);
                                             PROTO: int setregid(gid_t rgid, gid_t egid);
                                             RET: Both return 0 on success, or -1 on error

- The FIRST ARGUMENT to EACH of these SYSTEM CALLS is the NEW RID. The SECOND ARGUMENT is the NEW EID. If we
want to CHANGE ONLY ONE of the IDENTIFIERS, then we CAN SPECIFY -1 for the OTHER ARGUMENT.

- Originally DERIVED from BSD, "setreuid()" and "setregid()" are now SPECIFIED in SUSv3 and are AVAILABLE on
MOST UNIX implementations. 

- As with the other system calls described until now, RULES GOVERN the CHANGES that we can MAKE using
"setreuid()" and "setregid()". We can DESCRIBE these RULES from the POV of "setreuid()", with the
UNDERSTANDING that "setregid()" is SIMILAR, EXCEPT as noted:
      1) An UNPRIVILEGED PROCESS can SET the RUID ONLY to the CURRENT VALUE of the RUID (i.e., NO CHANGE) or
         EUID. The EUID can be ONLY SET to the CURRENT VALUE of the RUID, EUID (i.e., NO CHANGE), or SSUID.

               Note:  SUSv3 says that it is UNSPECIFIED WHETHER an UNPRIVILEGED PROCESS can use "setreuid()"
                    to CHANGE the VALUE of the RUID to the CURRENT VALUE of the RUID, EUID, or SSUID, and the
                    DETAILS of PRECISELY WHAT CHANGES can be MADE to the RUID VARY across implementations.
                      SUSv3 describes SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BEHAVIOUR for "setregid()": an UNPRIVILEGED PROCESS
                    can SET the RGID to the CURRENT VALUE of the SSGID or SET the EGID to the CURRENT VALUE of
                    EITHER the RGID or the SSGID. Again, the DETAILS of PRECISELY WHAT CHANGES can be made
                    VARY across implementations.

      2) A PRIVILEGED PROCESS can make ANY CHANGES to the IDs.
        
      3) For BOTH PRIVILEGED and UNPRIVILEGED PROCESSES, the SSUID is ALSO SET to the SAME VALUE as the (NEW)
         EUID if EITHER of the following IS TRUE:
            a) RUID is NOT -1 (i.e., the RUID is being set, EVEN to the SAME VALUE it ALREADY HAD), or
            b) the EUID is being set to a value OTHER than the VALUE of the RUID PRIOR to the call.

- Put conversely, if a process uses "setreuid()" ONLY to CHANGE the EUID to the SAME VALUE as the CURRENT RUID
, then the SSUID is LEFT UNCHANGED, and a LATER CALL to "setreuid()" (or "seteuid()") can RESTORE the EUID to
the SSUID value (SUSv3 DOESN'T SPECIFY the EFFECT of "setreuid()" and "setregid()" on the SSIDs, BUT SUSv4
SPECIFIES the BEHAVIOUR described here).

- The THIRD RULE provides a way for a SUID program to PERMANENTLY DROP its PRIVILEGE, using a call such as the
following:
       # setreuid(getuid(), getuid());

- A SUID-root PROCESS that wants to CHANGE BOTH its USER and GROUP CREDENTIALS to ARBITRARY VALUES should
FIRST CALL "setregid()" and THEN CALL "setreuid()". If the calls are made in OPPOSITE ORDER, then the
"setregid"() call will FAIL, because the program will NO LONGER be PRIVILEGED AFTER the CALL to "setreuid()".
SIMILAR REMARKS apply if we are using 'setresuid()" and "setresgid()" for this purpose.

               Note:  BSD releases UP TO and INCLUDING 4.3BSD DID NOT have the SSUID and SSGID (which are
                    nowadays MANDATED by SUSv3). Instead, on BSD, "setreuid()" and "setregid()" PERMITTED a
                    PROCESS to DROP and REGAIN PRIVILEGE by SWAPPING the VALUES of the RID and EID back and
                    forth. This had the UNDESIRABLE SIDE EFFECT of CHANGING the RUID in ORDER to CHANGE the
                    EUID.

- On MOST UNIX implementations, a process CAN'T DIRECTLY RETRIEVE (or UPDATE) its SSUID and SSGID. However,
Linux provides two (NONSTANDARD) system calls ALLOWING us to do JUST THAT: "getresuid()" and "getresgid()":
           DEP: #define _GNU_SOURCE
                #include <unistd.h>          PROTO: int getresuid(uid_t *ruid, uid_t *euid, uid_t *suid);
                                             PROTO: int getresgid(gid_t *rgid, gid_t *egid, gid_t *sgid);
                                             RET: Both return 0 on success, or -1 on error

- The "getresuid()" system call RETURNS the CURRENT VALUES of the calling process's RUID, EUID, and SSUID in
the LOCATIONS POINTED by its three arguments. The "getresgid()" system call DOES THE SAME for the
CORRESPONDING GIDs.

- The "setresuid()" system call ALLOWS the calling process to INDEPENDENTLY CHANGE the VALUES of ALL THREE
of its UIDs. The NEW VALUES for each of the UIDs are SPECIFIED by the THREE ARGUMENTS to the system call.
The "setresgid()" system call PERFORMS the ANALOGOUS TASK for the GIDs:
           DEP: #define _GNU_SOURCE
                #include <unistd.h>          PROTO: int setresuid(uid_t ruid, uid_t euid, uid_t suid);
                                             PROTO: int setresgid(gid_t rgid, gid_t egid, gid_t sgid);
                                             RET: Both return 0 on success, or -1 on error

- If we DON'T WANT to CHANGE ALL of the IDENTIFIERS, then SPECIFYING -1 for an argument LEAVES the
CORRESPONDING IDENTIFIER UNCHANGED. For example, the following call is EQUIVALENT to "seteuid(x)":
       # setresuit(-1, x, -1);

- The RULES about WHAT CHANGES may be MADE by "setresuid()" ("setresgid()" is SIMILAR) are as follows:
      1) An UNPRIVILEGED PROCESS can SET ANY of its RUID, EUID, and SSUID to ANY of the VALUES CURRENTLY in
         its CURRENT RUID, EUID, or SSUID.

      2) A PRIVILEGED PROCESS can make ARBITRARY CHANGES to its RUID, EUID, and SSUID.

      3) Regardless of WHETHER the call makes ANY CHANGES to OTHER IDs, the FILE-SYSTEM UID is ALWAYS SET to
         the SAME VALUE as the (POSSIBLY NEW) EUID.

- Calls to "setresuid()" and "setresgid()" have an ALL-OR-NOTHING EFFECT. Either ALL of the REQUESTED 
IDENTIFIERS are SUCCESSFULLY CHANGED or NONE ARE CHANGED (the SAME COMMENT applies with respect to the OTHER
system calls described in this chapter that change MULTIPLE identifiers).

- Although "setresuid()" and "setresgid()" provide the MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD API for changing PROCESS
CREDENTIALS, we CAN'T PORTABLY employ them in applications; they are NOT SPECIFIED in SUSv3 and are AVAILABLE
on ONLY a FEW OTHER UNIX implementations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- All of the PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED system calls that CHANGE the process's EUID or EGID also ALWAYS CHANGE the
CORRESPONDING FSID (File-system ID). To CHANGE the FSIDs INDEPENDENTLY of the EIDs, we MUST EMPLOY two
Linux-specific system calls: "setfsuid()" and "setfsgid()":
           DEP: #include <sys/fsuid.h>       PROTO: int setfsuid(uid_t fsuid);
                                             PROTO: int setfsgid(gid_t fsgid);
                                             RET: Always returns the previous FSUID/FSGID.

- The "setfsuid()" system call CHANGES the FSUID of a process to the VALUE SPECIFIED by "fsuid".
The "setfsgid()" system call CHANGES the FSGID to the VALUE SPECIFIED by "fsgid".

- Again, there are RULES about the KIND OF CHANGES that CAN BE MADE. The RULES for "setfsgid()" are SIMILAR to
the RULES for "setfsuid()", which are as follows:
      1) An UNPRIVILEGED PROCESS can SET the FSUID to the CURRENT VALUE of the RUID, EUID, FSUID (i.e., NO
         CHANGE), or SSUID.

      2) A PRIVILEGED PROCESS can SET the FSUID to ANY VALUE.

- The IMPLEMENTATION of these calls is SOMEWHAT UNPOLISHED. To begin with, there are NO CORRESPONDING system
calls that RETRIEVE the CURRENT VALUE of the FSIDs. In addition, the system calls do NO ERROR CHECKING; if an
UNPRIVILEGED PROCESS attempts to SET its FSID to an UNACCEPTABLE VALUE, the ATTEMPT is SILENTLY IGNORED.
The RETURN VALUE from EACH of these system calls is the PREVIOUS VALUE of the CORRESPONDING FSID, WHETHER the
call SUCCEEDS or FAILS. Thus, we do have a way of FINDING OUT the CURRENT VALUES of the FSIDs, BUT ONLY at
the SAME TIME AS WE TRY (EITHER successfuly or unsuccessfully) to CHANGE them.

- Use of the "setfsuid()" and "setfsgid()" system calls is NO LONGER NECESSARY on Linux and SHOULD BE AVOIDED
in applications DESIGNED to be PORTED to OTHER UNIX implementations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The "getgroups()" system call RETURNS the SET OF GROUPS of which the CALLING PROCESS is CURRENTLY a MEMBER,
in the ARRAY pointed to by "grouplist":
    DEP: #include <unistd.h>     PROTO: int getgroups(int gidsetsize, gid_t grouplist[]);
                                 RET: Returns number of GIDs placed in "grouplist" on success, or -1 on error

- On Linux, as on MOST UNIX implementations, "getgroups()" simply RETURNS the CALLING PROCESS'S SUPPLEMENTARY
GIDs. However, SUSv3 ALSO ALLOWS an implementation to INCLUDE the CALLING PROCESS'S EGID in the returned
"grouplist".

- The calling program MUST ALLOCATE the "grouplist" array and SPECIFY its LENGTH in the argument "gidsetsize".
On SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION, "getgroups()" returns the NUMBER OF GIDs placed in "grouplist".

- If the NUMBER OF GROUPS of which a process is a member EXCEEDS "gidsetsize", "getgroups()" returns an ERROR
('EINVAL'). To AVOID this POSSIBILITY, we CAN SIZE the "grouplist" array to be ONE GREATER (to PORTABLY ALLOW
for the POSSIBLE INCLUSION of the EGID) than the constant 'NGROUPS_MAX' (defined in <limits.h>), which DEFINES
the MAXIMUM NUMBER of SUPPLEMENTARY GROUPS of which a process MAY be a MEMBER. Thus, we COULD DECLARE
"grouplist" as follows:
            # gid_t grouplist[NGROUPS_MAX + 1];

- In Linux kernels PRIOR to 2.6.4, 'NGROUPS_MAX' has the value 32. From kernel 2.6.4 ONWARD, 'NGROUPS_MAX' has
the value 65,536 (2^16).

- An application can ALSO DETERMINE the 'NGROUPS_MAX' LIMIT at RUNTIME in the following ways:
       a) Call "sysconf(_SC_NGROUPS_MAX)";
       b) Read the LIMIT from the READ-ONLY, Linux-specific "/proc/sys/kernel/ngroups_max" file. This file
          is provided SINCE kernel 2.6.4.

- Alternatively, an application can make a call to "getgroups()" specifying "gidsetsize" as 0. In this case,
"grouplist" is NOT MODIFIED, but the RETURN VALUE of the call GIVES the NUMBER OF GROUPS of which the process
is a member.

- The value obtained by ANY of these RUN-TIME TECHNIQUES can then be USED to DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATE a
"grouplist" array for a FUTURE "getgroups()" call.

- A PRIVILEGED PROCESS can use "setgroups()" and "initgroups()" to CHANGE its SET OF SUPPLEMENTARY GIDs:
           DEP: #define _BSD_SOURCE
                #include <grp.h>            PROTO: int setgroups(size_t gidsetsize, const gid_t *grouplist);
                                            PROTO: int initgroups(const char *user, gid_t group);
                                            RET: Both return 0 on success, or -1 on error

- The "setgroups()" system call REPLACES the CALLING PROCESS'S SUPPLEMENTARY GIDs with the SET GIVEN in the
array "grouplist". The "gidsetsize" argument SPECIFIES the NUMBER OF GIDs in the array argument "grouplist".

- The "initgroups()" function INITIALIZES the CALLING PROCESS'S SUPPLEMENTARY GIDs by SCANNING "/etc/group"
and BUILDING a LIST of ALL GROUPS of which the named "user" is a MEMBER. In addition, the GID specified in
"group" is ALSO ADDED to the process's set of supplementary GIDs.

- The PRIMARY USERS of "initgroups()" are programs that CREATE LOGIN SESSIONS - for example, "login(1)", which
sets various process attributes prior to executing the user's login shell. Such programs TYPICALLY OBTAIN the
value to be used for the "group" argument by READING the GID field from the user's record in the PASSWORD
FILE. This is SLIGHTLY CONFUSING, since the GID from the PASSWORD FILE is NOT REALLY a SUPPLEMENTARY GROUP.
Instead, it DEFINES the INITIAL RGID, EGID, and SSGID of the LOGIN SHELL. Nevertheles, this is how
"initgroups()" is USUALLY EMPLOYED.

- Although NOT PART of SUSv3, "setgroups()" and "initgroups()" are AVAILABLE on ALL UNIX implementations.
