- Using the "MALLOC" family of functions, a process can DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATE and RELEASE memory on the HEAP.
In considering the IMPLEMENTATION of these funtions, we saw that VARIOUS THINGS can GO WRONG in a program that
MISHANDLES the BLOCKS of ALLOCATED MEMORY, and we noted that a number of DEBUGGING TOOLS are AVAILABLE to
HELP LOCATE the SOURCE of such ERRORS.

- The "alloca()" function ALLOCATES MEMORY on the STACK. This MEMORY is AUTOMATICALLY DEALLOCATED when the
function that calls "alloca()" returns.
