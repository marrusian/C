/*
*  7. Write a program that requests the hours worked in a week and then prints the gross pay,
* the taxes, and the net pay. Assume the following:
*    a. Basic pay rate = $10.00/hr
*    b. Overtime (in excess of 40 hours) = time and a half
*    c. Tax rate: 
          15% of the first $300
*         20% of the next $150
*         25% of the rest
*  Use #define constants, and donâ€™t worry if the example does not conform to current
* tax law.
