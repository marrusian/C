- Each user on the system is UNIQUELY IDENTIFIED, and users may belong to groups.

- Every user of the system has a UNIQUE LOGIN NAME (username) and a corresponding numeric USER ID (UID).
For each user, these are defined by a line in the system PASSWORD FILE ("/etc/passwd"), which includes
the following ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:
   a) Group ID: the numeric group ID of the FIRST of the groups of which the user is a member.
   b) Home directory: the initial directory into which the user is placed after logging in.
   c) Login shell: the name of the program to be exercuted to interpret user commands.

- The password record may ALSO include the user's password, in ENCRYPTED FORM. However, for SECURITY
REASONS, the password is often stored in a separate SHADOW PASSWORD file ("/etc/shadow"), which is readable
ONLY by PRIVILEGED USERS.

- For administrative purposes (in particular, for CONTROLLING access to files and other system resources)
it is USEFUL to ORGANIZE users into GROUPS. In EARLY UNIX implementations, a user could be a member of only
ONE group. Each group is IDENTIFIED by a single line in the system GROUP FILE ("/etc/group"), which
includes the following INFORMATION:
   a) Group name: the UNIQUE name of the group.
   b) Group ID (GID): the numeric ID associated with this group.
   c) User list: a comma-separated list of LOGIN NAMES of users who are MEMBERS of this groups.

- One user, known as the SUPERUSER, has SPECIAL PRIVILEGES within the system. The superuser account has
UID 0, and normally has the login name ROOT. On typical UNIX systems, the superuser BYPASSES all permission
checks in the system (thus, for example, it can access ANY FILE in the system, and can send signals to ANY
USER PROCESS). The SYSTEM ADMINISTRATOR uses the SUPERUSER ACCOUNT to perform various ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS
on the system.
