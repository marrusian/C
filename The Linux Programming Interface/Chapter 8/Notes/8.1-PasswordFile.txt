- The system PASSWORD FILE, "/etc/passwd", contains ONE LINE for EACH USER ACCOUNT on the system. Each LINE is
COMPOSED of SEVEN FIELDS separated by colons (:), as in the following example:
     mtk:x:1000:100:Michael Kerrisk:/home/mtk:/bin/bash

- In order, these fields are as follows:
    1) LOGIN NAME - This is the UNIQUE NAME that the user MUST ENTER in order to LOG IN. Often, this is ALSO
                    CALLED the USERNAME. We can ALSO CONSIDER the LOGIN NAME to be the HUMAN-READABLE
                    (symbolic) IDENTIFIER corresponding to the NUMERIC USER IDENTIFIER. Programs such as
                    "ls(1)" display THIS name, RATHER than the numeric user ID associated with the file, when
                    asked to show the OWNERSHIP of a file (as in "ls -l").

    2) ENCRYPTED PASSWORD - This field contains a 13-character ENCRYPTED PASSWORD. If the PASSWORD FIELD
                            contains ANY OTHER STRING - in particular, a string of OTHER THAN 13-characters -
                            then LOGINS to this ACCOUNT are DISABLED, since such a string CAN'T REPRESENT a
                            VALID ENCRYPTED PASSWORD. Note, however, that this field is IGNORED if SHADOW
                            PASSWORDS have been ENABLED (which is TYPICAL). In this case, the PASSWORD FIELD
                            "/etc/passwd" CONTAINS the LETTER 'x', and the ENCRYPTED PASSWORD is INSTEAD
                            STORED in the SHADOW PASSWORD FILE. If the PASSWORD FIELD in "/etc/passwd" is
                            EMPTY, then NO PASSWORD is REQUIRED to LOG IN to this account (this is true EVEN
                            IF shadow passwords are enabled).

             Note:  Here, we ASSUME that PASSWORDS are ENCRYPTED using Data Encryption Standard ("DES"), the
                  HISTORICAL and STILL WIDELY USED UNIX password-encryption scheme. It is POSSIBLE to REPLACE
                  "DES" with OTHER SCHEMES, such as MD5, which PRODUCES a 128-bit "MESSAGE DIGEST" (a KIND of
                  HASH) of its input. This value is STORED as a 32-character string in the PASSWORD
                  (or SHADOW PASSWORD) file.

    3) USER ID (UID) - This is the NUMERIC ID for this USER. If this FIELD has the VALUE 0, then this ACCOUNT
                       has SUPERUSER PRIVILEGES. There is NORMALLY ONE such account, with the LOGIN NAME
                       "root". On Linux 2.2 and EARLIER, UIDs are MAINTAINED as 16-bit values, ALLOWING the
                       RANGE [0, 65,535]; on Linux 2.4 and LATER, they are STORED using 32-bits, allowing a
                       MUCH LARGER range (i.e., [0, 2^32-1]).

             Note:  It is POSSIBLE (but UNUSUAL) to have MORE THAN ONE record in the PASSWORD FILE with the
                  SAME UID, thus permitting MULTIPLE LOGIN NAMES for the SAME UID. This allows MULTIPLE USERS
                  to ACCESS the SAME RESOURCES (e.g., files) using DIFFERENT PASSWORDS. The DIFFERENT LOGIN
                  NAMES can be ASSOCIATED with DIFFERENT SETS of GIDs.

    4) GROUP ID (GID) - This is the NUMERIC ID of the FIRST of the GROUPS of which this user is a MEMBER.
                        Further GROUP MEMBERSHIPS for this user are DEFINED in the SYSTEM GROUP FILE.

    5) COMMENT - This field holds text about the user. This text is displayed by various programs, such as
                 "finger(1)".

    6) HOME DIRECTORY - This is the INITIAL DIRECTORY into which the USER is PLACED after LOGGING IN. This
                        field BECOMES the VALUE of the "HOME" environment variable.

    7) LOGIN SHELL - This is the program to which CONTROL is TRANSFERRED once the user is LOGGED IN. Usually,
                     this is ONE of the SHELLS, such as "bash", BUT it can be ANY PROGRAM. If this field is
                     EMPTY, then the LOGIN SHELL DEFAULTS to "bin/sh", the Bourne Shell. This field BECOMES
                     the VALUE of the "SHELL" environment variable.

- On a STAND-ALONE SYSTEM, ALL the PASSWORD INFORMATION resides in the file "/etc/passwd". However, if we are
using a SYSTEM such as Network Information System (NIS) or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) to
DISTRIBUTE PASSWORDS in a NETWORK ENVIRONMENT, then PART or ALL of this INFORMATION resides on a REMOTE 
SYSTEM. As long as programs accessing password information EMPLOY functions like "getpwnam()", "getpwuid()"
and so on, the use of NIS or LDAP is TRANSPARENT to applications. SIMILAR comments APPLY regarding the
SHADOW PASSWORD and GROUP FILES.
